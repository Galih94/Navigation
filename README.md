# Navigation
This is a basic learning technique project diving deep into SwiftUI's navigation using NavigationStack to handle screen transitions, both in response to user actions and programmatically. It also explores advanced navigation concepts like state restoration and customizing navigation bars for a polished user experience.

The source learning is from 9th project of course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
